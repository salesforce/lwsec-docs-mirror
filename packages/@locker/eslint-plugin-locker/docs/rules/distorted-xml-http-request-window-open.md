## XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open

The [`XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/open) method initializes a newly-created request, or re-initializes an existing one.

Lightning Web Security disallows access to URL endpoints containing `"/aura"` and `"/webruntime"` because they are part of the Lightning Component framework.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion examines the `hostname` and the `pathname` of the URL. If there's a match to a disallowed endpoint, it throws an exception.

## window.open

The [`window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) method loads the specified resource into a new or existing browsing context with the specified name. If the name doesn't exist, then a new browsing context is opened in a new tab or a new window, and the specified resource is loaded into it.

This new browsing context isnâ€™t sandboxed properly and malicious code can access system mode, so Lightning Web Security distorts the `window` object returned.

### Distorted Behavior

The returned `window` object has the same distortions applied to it as the originating sandbox.
